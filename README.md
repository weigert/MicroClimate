Finite Volume Navier Stokes solves for wind-patterns around terrain with pressure linked in. The terrain acts as a "choking" boundary condition - imagine a glass-pane sitting on top of the highest point of the terrain, parallel to sealevel.

Transport equations move humidity and temperature around.

Thermodynamics of water vapor, along with energy and mass transfer source terms, then give the climate dynamics.

Detailed explanation to follow.
